EKG2 NEXT GENERATION BOT
=======================

Very old plugins that I wrote years ago, now mainly serves purpose as
nostalgic code.

I used those scripts to help users manage their shell torrent accounts.
Bot operates on Gadu-Gadu protocol.

This program used to be my favourite and it really kicked ass!!


## Usage

I do not remember correctly the steps, but it goes like this...
You need EKG2 installed first.  Then you would pull those files and
initialize plugins by loading `init.py` with some commands that I can't
remember.
